I hold skills in the following areas:

* I studied computer access control for my [[PhD]].
* [[Computers]]: [[Linux]], [[Mythtv]], FreeSWITCH, etc.
* [[Flying]]: Flying a light aircraft from point A to point B through the sky.
* [[Hobbies/Music]]: Travel from point A to point B through the sky.

I ensure my skills remain up-to-date by constantly researching new solutions
for old problems and attending [[Conferences]] right around the globe.
