I hold skills in the following areas:

* I studied computer access control for my [[PhD]].
* [[Asterisk]]: Open source telephone exchange system.
* [[Flying]]: Travel from point A to point B through the sky.
* [[Linux]]: Alternative operating system to Microsoft Windows.
* [[Mythtv]]: For watching TV via the computer.

I ensure my skills remain up-to-date by constantly researching new solutions
for old problems and attending [[Conferences]] right around the globe.
