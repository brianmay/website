I have a PhD in computer access control, including authentication protocols
such as [Kerberos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos) and authorisation
protocols such as
[SPKI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_public_key_infrastructure). I
obtained my PhD in 2002 from [Monash University in
Clayton](http://monash.edu.au/campuses/clayton/).
