[Asterisk](http://www.asterisk.org/) is an open source PBX system. I have
installed such a setup at my home. I have Asterisk configured to use two
upstream analogue connections to Telstra exchanges. One of these is advertised
is my voice line, and the other is advertised as my fax line. If a voice call
comes in my voice line, but it is busy, it gets redirected to the second line.
Asterisk will immediately answer the phone and check if it is a fax or not. If
it is not a fax, it will cause all the extensions to ring. If it is a fax, then
Asterisk will receive the fax using internal DSP algorithms.

I have Asterisk connected to a analogue cordless telephone via a VOIP box, and
several other analogue extensions. I also use the TDM400 card with 2 FXO
(exchange ports) and 2 FXS (extension) ports. My server is running Debian
stable (sarge), using Asterisk I recompiled from unstable (sid).

## Benefits

For me Asterisk provides the following benefits:

* If one extension is left off hook, incoming calls can still get through on the other extensions.
* Minimum confusion when multiple answer the same phone call at the same time.
* Voice messages get emailed to you.
* Other people can't barge in and interrupt.
* Maximizes the use of two external telephone lines. We don't receive faxes often, and having a line dedicated to faxes seemed a waste.

To be fair, some of these advantages could be achieved with any PBX system.
However, Asterisk is the only solution I know of that I can afford. When I
inquired about a cheap commercial PBX system, I found the minimum cost (from
memory) was about $4,000.

## Disadvantages

The disadvantage with Asterisk is that is is extra complexity, and this could
in theory make the telephone system less reliable. This has to be considered
against features that make it more reliable, e.g. one off-hook phone won't
bring the entire system down.

The other disadvantage is that there are new procedures to learn for
transferring calls between phones.

It is also worth noting that Asterisk does not mean incoming phone calls get
redirected to the desired person. This is because Asterisk has no way of
knowing which person the phone call is for. A interactive menu would fix this,
but I do not like interactive menus and I suspect my callers do not like them
either. Another possibility would be to send the caller to a particular
extension based on their caller-id.
