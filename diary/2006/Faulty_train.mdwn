# Faulty train
Date: 2006-11-14 09:45:31

This morning was an "exciting time" at Upper Ferntree Gully station, as the 7:31 arrived five minutes late, was declared faulty, and then waited for the next train from the city to clear the single track section (10 minutes total waiting).

As a result, the 7:31 really left at 7:47, which effectively was the same as cancelling the 7:31 and the 7:39. Almost all seats were taken by the next station (Ferntree Gully) and there were crowds waiting at the next stations until Ringwood. After Bayswater the train was as congested as it normally is after Richmond.

The defective train was parked at the south platform at Ringwood station - I assume this was the best spot they had to more it out of the way (without delaying trains more by shunting it at Bayswater). At least I assume it was the same train because it also was a Hitachi...

Maybe the new motto for public transport in Melbourne could be "never a dull moment!" <grin>.
