# Late for exam
Date: 1992-12-01 12:07:23

(written from memory 2007-02-16)

I had a year 11 (maths?) exam, so I arranged to get to school early (1hour to 2 hours early).

At Ringwood station, we were told to get off the train and use the bus replacement service.

I caught an early bus - and it unexpected go express past Mitcham. When we finally stopped at Blackburn I complained to the Bus driver, who told me to catch the bus back. This bus then stopped right outside my school, but I wasn't allowed to get out ("this bus is a train service - it only stops at train stations"). I probably should have mentioned my exam to this bus driver, too.

As a result, I was late for my exam..... My teacher offered to give me an extension, but I still wasn't thinking straight and I refused. I never did find out what happened that day, it might have been a level crossing accident - but nobody was saying anything. I think I heard rumours that the overhead power lines had come down.
