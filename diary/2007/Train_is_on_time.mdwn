# Train is on time
Date: 2007-02-15 20:21:46

At 8:21am, I was on a Lilydale train at Heatherdale station, at the train was exactly on time.

Unfortunately, the electronics couldn't cope with this rare anomaly;
the electronic sign said the train was running 9 minutes late and
there was the standard verbal announcement "... the next train will be
the Lilydale train which will arrive in 9 minutes. Connex apologises
for any inconvenience".
