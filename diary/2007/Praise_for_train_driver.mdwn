Sent 2007-02-16 to Connex via their online E-Mail form concerning [[Signal_point_failure]]:

<blockquote><p>Hello,</p>

<p>I wish to thank the driver of the 7:47 train from Upper Ferntree Gully station for providing regular and detailed updates on the delays at the time, all the way from Bayswater station through to Richmond.</p>

<p>While this doesn't excuse the signal/point failure at Box Hill, or the fact the train was almost an hour late, it made the wait bearable knowing what was happening and why.</p>

<p>The slightly technical explanations were equally appreciated. I don't like being treated like an idiot, and this driver certainly didn't try to oversimplify things or try to make lame excuses.</p>

<p>Thanks.
