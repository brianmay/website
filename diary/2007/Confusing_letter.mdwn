# Confusing letter

I received this confusing letter from Connex today.

The letter says I had already submitted a claim using the ticket.  Monthly
ticket I used to support a claim for compensation. How do I submit a
ticket then if I am not allowed to submit the ticket?

Connex replied and say they need more time to respond:

<blockquote>

<p>Mr Brian May</p>

Eventually they sent me a letter via post which clarified the issue:

<blockquote>
<p>23 May 2007</p>

<p>We refer to your telephone call to the Customer Feedback Line on 11 May 2007, regarding
your claim for compensation for network-wide performance in February 2007.</p>

<p>As stated in our letter dated 4 May 2007, your application for compensation under the
Connex Service Commitment Code for February 2007, has not been approved as our
records indicate a claim has already been submitted using the ticket you provided to
support your claim for compensation.</p>

<p>A review of our records confirms that that the same ticket was used to claim compensation
in January and February 2007. The ticket was a Monthly Zone 123 which expired on 2
February 2007</p>

<p>Where the customer holds a monthly ticket, this ticket can only be used to support a single
compensation claim and cannot be used to support claims for compensation across two
months, even where the ticket has been used in both months.</p>

<p>Compensation is currently available for January, February, and March 2007. Our records
indicate that you have received compenstation for January and March.</p>

<p>If you held a periodical ticket that was valid from 3-28 February, you may submit a claim
with the original or a photocopy of the expired ticket. Please quote the reference number
at the top of thsi letter on your claim.</p>

<p>Should you require any further information, please contact Connex Customer Feedback on
1800 800 705.

Thank you for taking the tike to contact us.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely</p>

Apparently I had submitted my January Monthly ticket trice, once for
compensation in January, and then again for compensation in February. I think it
is very sneaky, because nowhere is it indicated that you can only claim
compensation once for each monthly ticket. I could have claimed compensation
for January with my February ticket, March with with March ticket, and not been
able to claim compensation for February even though I purchased a monthly ticket
for each month.

In this case I hadn't done this (I almost did so but was paranoid enough not
to), so simply resending the compensation claim with the correct ticket solved
the issue.
