# Lost control
Date: 2007-03-08 22:30:39

This morning when driving, I lost control of the car and spun 270 degrees and reversed in next to the side of the road. This was in the steep corner at Tremont. I lost control again at Devils Elbow.

Yesterday we checked the brakes in the car, and today I swapped the rear right hand wheel with the spare wheel, as the rear wheel was lacking in tread, but the spare tear is brand new.
