# Train terminated without notice

Today my train arrived at Box Hill station, as usual. The only warning sign something was wrong was we stopped at platform 4, not platform 3, and there wasn't a Blackburn train terminating on platform 3. We waited.

When the Ringwood train passed us on Platform 3, I started getting worried.

The next train, a Blackburn train passed us on Platform 3, and we were given an automatic message the train might be delayed by 10 minutes, so I got off and caught the next Lilydale train from Platform 3 (fortunately my gamble paid off and it left first...).

At Ringwood I changed to the Belgrave train, which still wasn't the train stranded at Box Hill, but the next one. I didn't notice any people from my Belgrave train on this one, and it looked relatively quiet, so I guess they were still waiting on the train at Box Hill.

I have no idea what the problem was, because they didn't say.

(it goes without saying I missed my bus connection).
