There were no trains from Belgrave to Bayswater (all day), so my trip into the
city was slower then usual:

At Knox City I just missed the 901 bus to Ringwood, and decided
to catch the 664 to Bayswater. In hindsight I would have been better
if if I caught the next 901 to Ringwood, because of the long
wait for the first train at Bayswater. There would have been more
trains at Ringwood.
