# Australia's first ever live televised overseas broadcast

Brian May shared the following post written by Jeremy Visser:

Were you around in 1966 when a freak accident allowed a 2-way broadcast between BBC &amp; ABC?<br /><br />When the geo-stationary communications satellite Intelsat II accidentally strayed from its planned position into an elliptical orbit, it provided a unique opportunity: for a 30-minute window, Australia would have the chance to send and receive a signal via the satellite to BBC audiences in England.<br /><br />Although there had already been two-way broadcasts between the US and England across the Atlantic, this freak mishap made it possible for the first time to send a signal that circumnavigated the globe.

> Three British families in Carnarvon, WA, made broadcasting history as they talked to their families in London in Australia's first live satellite link up.
