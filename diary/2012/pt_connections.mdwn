# PT Connections

I regularly star back in the city until late, so I can attend computer meetings
in the city. The end anyway from 8pm to after 9pm.

To get home from these meetings, I would like to catch a train to Upper
Ferntree Gully (UFTG) and then a bus up the mountain (688).

Unfortunately, the connections between the train service and the bus service
have not been properly thought out. Here is a table. The columns in order are:

1. fs: the time the train leaves Flinders Street station.
2. uftg: the next column is when it is suppose to arrive at UFTG station.
3. bus: when the bus (if any) is due to depart.
4. wait: how long the waiting time is between train and bus.
5. croydon wait: how long you would have to wait for the train back to the city at Croydon (not that I travel this far).

| fs    | uftg  | bus   | wait | croydon wait |
|-------|-------|-------|------|-----|
| 18:24 | 19:22 | 19:31 |    9 |  11 |
| 18:35 | 19:36 |       |   40 |     |
| 18:58 | 19:55 |       |   21 |     |
| 19:11 | 20:09 | 20:16 |    7 |  24 |
| 19:20 | 20:27 |       |   45 |     |
| 19:35 | 20:41 |       |   31 |     |
| 20:05 | 21:09 | 21:12 |    3 |  28 |
| 20:35 | 21:41 |       |      |     |
| 21:05 | 22:09 |       |      |     |
| 21:34 | 22:41 |       |      |     |

The first problem is that the last bus leaves at 21:12. This means I have to
leave the city about 20:00 in order to catch it. Some of my meetings don't
finish until an hour later. More time is required depending on the location of
the meeting in order to get to the train station.

The next problem is that there is only one hour between bus services, however
there are two train services with not connecting bus. This means I have to plan
my time carefully to ensure I catch the connecting bus. Often this means I have
to sneak out of meetings early in order to ensure I catch the correct train.

The third problem, and the topic for discussion in this article, is that the
trains are often running late. Typically there is no reason for the trains to
run late, no train in front to slow them down, and few passengers to get off at
the majority of stations. No excuses are given. Regardless, it isn't unsual for
the trains to be 5 to 10 minutes late.

This means the connection to the bus service fails because only 7 minutes
allowance is given for one bus service, and only 3 minutes allowance is given
for the last bus service. This is very strange time tabling, as the last bus
could have been scheduled to leave later and still make the train at croydon
with plenty of time to spare.

These are connections that are officially documented in the official timetables.

Also I can't leave on the earlier train, this would mean leaving my meetings
even earlier, with a long useless waiti, in the freezing cold, at UFTG station.

I have complained to the various operators about the problem, this is a summary of the
communications I have had so far. I have not added any comments except in the conclusion
section, just because I haven't commented on something doesn't mean to  imply that
I agree or disagree with what was said.

Furthermore, this isn't a comphrensive list of issues I have encountered with
this bus connection by any means.

Another topic for another day will be the timetable that means the 732 bus from
Knox City arrives at Upper Ferntree Gully station just after the 688 bus
leaves.

I haven't even studied the connections between the 693 and the 688 buses
(required for example if you live along the 688 route and want to visit Monash
University. At quick glance this looks equally as bad.

## Before 2011

I told a Connex manager of the issues at a "ask our managers" session, at
Melbourne Central station. He responded by saying it is the fault of the bus
company for not waiting for the train when it is running late, saying some bus
companies are small businesses and implying they don't care as a result.

## 2011-06-30

On the 2011-06-30 the connection failed.

2011-07-02: On the following Saturday (2011-07-02) I sent a complaint to
Ventura Bus, Metro Trains, and DOT.

2011-07-04: Ventura Bus responded.

> Hello Mr May,
> I have read your email and will respond only to the bus related questions, the only thing I can suggest in relation to how do you know if the bus has gone is not to move away from the bus stop and ring the number  of the depot on 97521444 to find out where the bus is, I know you ran to check down the road to check to see if the bus had gone but as you know that can cause other issues by missing a late running bus by not being at the stop.
> We understand the inconvenience of missing the last bus so if you suspect you are running late or the moment you know you are running late please call and we hold back the bus for you.

## Conclusion

It is unfortunate that delays to trains often happen after Box Hill,
especially at Ringwood station. So it isn't possible to know that I should ring
up the bus company until the train departs Ringwood station. Even then, it is
likely that the train will have to wait before Ferntree Gully station because
it is late, and the city bound train got priority over the single line track.

PTV was set up to deal with connection issues like this. Unfortunately I cannot
see any way of complaining to PTV. If I put a complaint through to PTV, it
appears that they will forward it on to the operators without any
consideration.  This doesn't help because the operators will blame each other
instead of trying to resolve the complaint.

For some reason Ventura Bus has been trying to blame Metlink for the bad
time table (I have heard on good authority that Metlink publish the timetables,
the operators write the timetables), Metlink is apparently responsible for the
trains running on time (No, that is Metro Trains responsibility), as well as
Yarra Trains (no such operator).

At the present time, I am not getting any responses, not even automatic
responses from PTV.

Metro Trains does not appear to be investigating any of my complaints. The only
responses I have been getting are from Ventura Bus, which seem to indicate that
they are not interested in resolving the problem.

There are too many operators involved. What I would really like is for PTV,
