# programs that change their behaviour based on argv[0]

Oops. Looks like a genuine bug report in my Debian package, Heimdal,(<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=644138" class="ot-anchor">http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=644138</a>) has turned into a thread full of complaints on programs that change their behaviour based on argv[0] &lt;<a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.kerberos.heimdal.general/6756" class="ot-anchor">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.kerberos.heimdal.general/6756</a>&gt;.<br />Does seem like upstream is happy to accept patches to fix both problems.  However, if you are thinking of doing something similar in your project, be warned that people might object.
