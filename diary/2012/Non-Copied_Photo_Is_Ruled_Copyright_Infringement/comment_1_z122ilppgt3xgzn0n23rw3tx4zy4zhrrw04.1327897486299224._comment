This decision concerns me because it is possible that the &quot;copy&quot; could have been created without any reference or knowledge of the original. The post processing seems to be a key feature in the judgement, but is hardly unique or non-obvious, especially for such popular photography subjects.<br /><br />If it was a copy, they would have copied the same angle, which IMHO leads to a better composition. However I think there aren&#39;t many places you can take a photo of Big Ben from, so it probably is very certain that there any many photos of Big Ben taken by different photographers from the same angle.<br /><br />Replicating a photo requires more then just taking a photo of the same area, you need to get the same angle, objects in same position,  environment the same (e.g. sun, wind, etc); unless you don&#39;t care in which case it isn&#39;t really a copy. Its just yet another photo of a famous tourist destination.
