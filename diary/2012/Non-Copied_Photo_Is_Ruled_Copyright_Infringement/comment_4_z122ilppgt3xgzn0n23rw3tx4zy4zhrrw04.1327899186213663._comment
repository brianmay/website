I&#39;m playing devils advocate here. But could the modification to the angle be an attempt to avoid scrutiny or charge by authorities for copying the picture?<br /><br />I think a defined set of rules defining how much must be different for it to be a copy is far too hard to define. Furthermore, defining such a set would just set a yard stick for people attempting to circumvent the problem.<br /><br />Despite all of this, I think the trumping point is that the user of the image previously tried to use it without paying licensing fees. This to me portrays a motive to circumvent paying the artists when constructing the image.
