Hmmm... I get your point. However it now puts other artists in a difficult situation. Lets say I find a photo of a bus in front of Big Ben. I might have one from my trip in 2000. Am I likely to get sued if I try to enhance it in a similar way?<br /><br />Copyright can restrict innovation and creativity which often thrive on being able to take an existing piece of work and enhance it or do it in a different way; sure you can try to license the works at considerable cost (for personal works?), but the copyright owner can always say no just because they aren&#39;t interested in what you are doing.
