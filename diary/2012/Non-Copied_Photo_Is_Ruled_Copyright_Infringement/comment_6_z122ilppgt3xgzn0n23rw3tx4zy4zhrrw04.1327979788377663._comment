I&#39;m by and large against copyright in science, patents included. But in the case of a work of art, if you are making money by deliberately attempting to replicate someone else&#39;s art without licensing, then how is the artist going to survive?<br /><br />It is a grey area unfortunately. I don&#39;t know the solution to not restricting innovation and creativity whilst compensating artists. Perhaps art in its traditional form is no longer a viable job? Perhaps artists need to be able to do more than what a computer can do in order to be profitable. <br /><br />A photo cannot be a work of art in my opinion, as it is just a record of an event, and you cannot put copyright on an arrangement of objects in the world. I also don&#39;t think a series of clicks of a mouse (e.g. A recipe for an effect in photoshop or after effects) can be copyrightable. The combination of the two should not be any more copyrightable.<br /><br />In this case, I feel it is more similar to counterfeiting. Given the person stole someone&#39;s art, refused to pay a license, took them to court and lost, all before replicating their art, I think the motive makes it a crime. I do not think that artist can claim ownership of the arrangement of mouse clicks and objects which created the art.
