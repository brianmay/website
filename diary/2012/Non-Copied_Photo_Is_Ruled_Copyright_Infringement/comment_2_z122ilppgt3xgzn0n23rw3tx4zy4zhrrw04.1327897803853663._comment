In this case (according to the article). An artist found their photo in use, requested licensing money, it went to court, the judge found in favour of the artist. So the business which was using it, went out and replicated the photo with a slightly different angle and use that. The artist then sued saying they have copied my photo to avoid the licensing.<br /><br />If it was just a picture of a landmark, then I could see this as being fair. But the photo has significant after effects applied to it. It is constructed using a bus, from a certain angle, colour effects, masking and some work on the sky. This seems more like a work of art than just a photo of a landmark.<br /><br />Given there is significant proof the business had already seen the original photo. It seems it is unlikely it can be proven it was just a coincidence.<br /><br />Finally, their is significant motive the business was actively avoiding paying the artists licensing fees for their photo.
