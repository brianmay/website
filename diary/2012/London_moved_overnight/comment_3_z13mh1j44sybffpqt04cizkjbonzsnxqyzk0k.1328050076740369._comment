No, I wasn&#39;t aware. I liked Cornwall as a county, so will have to revisit it now it&#39;s a city. <br /><br />Also, what happened to Cardiff? And Edinburgh? Glasgow? Newcastle? Birmingham? Manchester? I would have thought the news would have at least mentioned in passing if they&#39;d just disappeared...
