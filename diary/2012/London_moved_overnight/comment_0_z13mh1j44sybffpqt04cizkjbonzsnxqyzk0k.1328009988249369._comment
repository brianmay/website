So London&#39;s moved to Norfolk? It happens, I guess. I notice cities often move around a bit. <br /><br />Often happens in Australia -- at least if you believe road signs. Often you&#39;ll see a sign saying (eg.) the next town is 10km away... then you drive 5km, and the next sign says the same city is 7km away. The only rational explanation is that the city is moving away from you.<br /><br />I hope Londoners like Norfolk...
