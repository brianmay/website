# Latrobe Valley accident

AO-2007-065: Cessna Aircraft Company 172M, VH-EUI and Amateur Built Avid Flyer, 28-0929, Latrobe Valley Aerodrome Vic.

[Preliminary report](http://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/investigation_reports/2007/AAIR/aair200707452.aspx) now available.

From the report:

> Sometime later, as the aircraft had progressed in the circuit, two aircraft attempted
> to make a radio broadcast together, and the instructor in the second Cessna 172
> reported that he broadcast that there had been an over-transmission and that the
> transmission indicated that both aircraft had called on final approach. In response to
> that broadcast, it was reported that the pilot of the Avid broadcast that ‘he had the
> other aircraft in sight’. The instructor reported that he noticed that there appeared to
> be two aircraft in close proximity on final approach to runway 09. It was reported
> that shortly after that, the Cessna and the Avid collided while on final approach to
> runway 09.

We will have to wait until the final report.
