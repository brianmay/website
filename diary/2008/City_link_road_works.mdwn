# City link road works
Date: 2008-10-29 19:00:00

My bus to Fishermen's bend arrived at 9:28am instead of 9:06am, because of
delays, due to road works.

First problems occured on Queensberry Bridge Road, as it was closed off past
Whiteman st. Cars were expected to turn left or right, and the right hand turn
traffic light cycle at this intersection is very small. Trams could get through, and
busses could also get through to (via the left hand turn lane). It didn't affect
traffic travelling north down the road.

Second, there were extensive delays on Montague Street, possibly because the
left hand lane was closed.  I could not see any reason for this lane to be
closed, except for the fact there were vehicles parked in it to warn motorists
that the lane was closed.
