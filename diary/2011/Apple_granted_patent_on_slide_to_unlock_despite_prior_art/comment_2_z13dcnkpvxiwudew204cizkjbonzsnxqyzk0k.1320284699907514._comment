There probably is. Safest to assume so. Don&#39;t check, as there&#39;s probably a patent on checking patents.<br /><br />I did think about patenting &quot;a method for filing patents&quot; so that nobody could file a patent without paying me. Maybe I should just patent accepting bribes, so that at least I get a share of the money...
