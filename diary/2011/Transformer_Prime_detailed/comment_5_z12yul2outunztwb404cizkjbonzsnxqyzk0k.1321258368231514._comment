Okay, sounds good. Are you able to use the keyboard + tablet on the train?<br /><br />My phone has accent support on the software keyboard. Sometimes it misinterprets a tap as a long tap, and I get a menu of characters with accents. Annoying if you&#39;re trying to type something quickly. Useful when you do need to use characters with accents.<br /><br />By the way, the courier was correct. Level 1 is one floor above ground level. The building&#39;s architect clearly got it wrong... ;-)
