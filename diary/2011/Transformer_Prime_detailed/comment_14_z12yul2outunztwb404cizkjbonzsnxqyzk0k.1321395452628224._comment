Tried to use Polaris Office yesterday to take notes. It crashed and lost everything. Doesn&#39;t seem to support autosave or recovery. Then tried Memo, a notepad. It doesn&#39;t support autosave either, and has a limit of 1500 characters. I got to the limit and couldn&#39;t type any more. I think there might be better apps for note taking, will research. If not, there is always gmail which will autosave draft emails to the cloud and could be very good for the purpose.
