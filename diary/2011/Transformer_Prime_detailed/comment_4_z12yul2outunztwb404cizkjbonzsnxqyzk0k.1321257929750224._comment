Got my keyboard and case today.<br /><br />It got delivered to a different company on Level 2, despite Level 1 being clearly marked on the package. Seems like he was thinking Level 1 was above the Ground Floor, but they are the same thing. The buttons in the lift should have made this obvious. Fortunately, with a bit of guess work, I found it.<br /><br />Also got a Samsung book cover. Seems to be good, but unfortunately a bit awkward to remove it, and I have to remove the cover first or it won&#39;t fit on the keyboard. I guess that is my major complaint so far.<br /><br />I need to look into how to carry the keyboard around, without having other things in my bag squash the keys in.<br /><br />By my scales, Tablet is 580g, Keyboard is 600g, and book cover is 240g.<br /><br />So far I am happy with the purchase. The keyboard works perfectly, without any problems (many reviewers say it didn&#39;t work for them). Robust feel and lightweight feel to it. I didn&#39;t have to reset anything, power off anything or change any settings, it just worked. I haven&#39;t noticed this keyboard lag everyone seems to talk about either.<br /><br />Some keys have accent support - push and hold the button, and you get a menu asking which variant you want. A bit weird, but I can live with that.<br /><br />connectbot doesn&#39;t seem to recognize the Ctrl or Tab keys, I might have to file a bug against connectbot on this. Oh wait, looks like one of the existing reports might already cover this, e.g. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/connectbot/issues/detail?id=369" class="ot-anchor">http://code.google.com/p/connectbot/issues/detail?id=369</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/connectbot/issues/detail?id=471" class="ot-anchor">http://code.google.com/p/connectbot/issues/detail?id=471</a> <br /><a href="http://code.google.com/p/connectbot/issues/detail?id=480" class="ot-anchor">http://code.google.com/p/connectbot/issues/detail?id=480</a><br />While none of these specifically cover this tablet, they all look very similar to me.
