Samsung has an app called &quot;Polaris Office&quot; installed both on my phone and tablet; doesn&#39;t seem to be available on the Android market however. There are lots of apps in the market, no idea which ones are any good. Also for editing/saving support looks like you have to pay $. e.g. &quot;Kingsoft Office&quot; or &quot;DocumentsToGo Full Version Key&quot;. Personally would like to see LibreOffice :-)
