Doesn&#39;t surprise me, I think the previous model was wifi only too. Maybe they are worried about 3G patents?<br /><br />Where the ASUS shine though is with the portable keyboard that can be carried with the tablet in a &quot;laptop&quot; form. The Galaxy 10.1 has a number of &quot;keyboard cases&quot; but the ones I have looked at are designed for use on a sturdy table, and are awkward to use on your lap. Making it unsuitable for taking notes, say at a conference where you are only given a seat. The &quot;keyboard dock&quot; according to one review is good for lap use, but heavier and not needs to be carried as a separate entity.<br /><br />I have have placed a order for the Galaxy 10.1 keyboard dock, so will be interested to see what is is actually like, compared with the very conflicting reviews that fail to give basic information.<br /><br />Most reviews for these devices always seem to miss out on the basics, such as how much it weighs (&quot;lightweight&quot; doesn&#39;t mean anything), ease of carrying it, or ease of using it on your lap.
