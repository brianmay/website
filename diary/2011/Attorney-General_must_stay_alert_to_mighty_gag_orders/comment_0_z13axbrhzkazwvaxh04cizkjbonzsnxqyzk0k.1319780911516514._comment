Somehow, I don&#39;t think this would be a defence (though of course I Am Not A Lawyer(TM)). How did you find out about X in the first place? Any interested parties would already be aware of the super-injunction, and should not have told you anything. Of course, they could use very heavy hints, in the way the Guardian newspaper did in the UK: <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/david-allen-green/2011/05/mainstream-media-social" class="ot-anchor">http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/david-allen-green/2011/05/mainstream-media-social</a><br /><br />For what it&#39;s worth, here is one of the few articles I&#39;ve read in <b>defence</b> of super-injunctions: <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/david-allen-green/2011/05/superinjunctions-media-court" class="ot-anchor">http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/david-allen-green/2011/05/superinjunctions-media-court</a> -- worth a read.
