# IPv6 support for 3G networks

3G is the major network transport that is still missing any sort of IPv6 support, at least in Australia.

> Did you ever want to have a high-level overview of how 3G/4G mobile networks work? Where GGSN and SGSN fit in? What the PDP contexts are ... and why you need two for dual-stack connectivity? All that (and a lot more) is explained in very well written IETF draft IPv6 in 3GPP Evolved Packet System. Reading highly recommended.
