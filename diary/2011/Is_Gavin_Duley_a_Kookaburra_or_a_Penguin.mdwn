# Is Gavin Duley a Kookaburra or a Penguin?

[Brian May](https://plus.google.com/115093849423083837632) posted [this note](https://plus.google.com/115093849423083837632/posts/ULnhdVPLwEV) on Google+.

Gavin Duley says he looks like Kookaburra in one profile (<span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a href="https://plus.google.com/108022132372970945736" class="proflink" oid="108022132372970945736">Gavin Duley</a></span>) and a Penguin in another (<span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a href="https://plus.google.com/108420623817919565558" class="proflink" oid="108420623817919565558">Gavin Duley</a></span>). I am confused. How can one person have two completely different appearances? Is Google+ lying to me? What happens if Tux were to find out that he is a Kookaburra disguised as a penguin? Or maybe he is a penguin disguised as a Kookaburra? Or, unlikely, could it be that he is a human disguised as a bird?
