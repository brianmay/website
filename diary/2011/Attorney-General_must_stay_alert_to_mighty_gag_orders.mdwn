# Attorney-General must stay alert to mighty gag orders

&quot;So - let&#39;s see if I understand this.<br /><br />An injunction against publishing X is granted.<br /><br />On top of this another one forbidding publication of the fact that the original injunction even exists is granted.<br /><br />What, then, if someone publishes information relating to the subject matter of X?<br /><br />Surely a complete defence would be that one had no knowledge that there was an injunction against doing so, and one had no method by which one could find out.<br /><br />Anything else leads one to fall foul of a law that is secret and so anyone could be guilty of such an offence at any time.<br /><br />That <b>has</b> to be crap and opposed.&quot;
