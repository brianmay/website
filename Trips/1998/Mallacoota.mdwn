This event was organized by the owners of Lilydale airport. I flew Charlie
Whisky Whisky (CWW) from Lilydale airport to Bairnsdale airport where we
stopped briefly for refuelling. At Mallacoota we stayed two nights (23/10/1998
to 25/10/1998), and went on a cruise. One the way back, the owners of Lakes
Entrance airport provided as with BBQ lunch.
