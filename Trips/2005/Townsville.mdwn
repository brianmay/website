## Day 1: Wednesday

We arrive at Townsville after a long flight. Unfortunately our luggage didn't

wasn't removed from the aircraft before it left for Cairns. 

We met Ziggy, my Sister Rose's dog.

## Day 2: Thursday

The airliner delivered our luggage to my Rose's house.

## Day 3: Friday

Woof.

## Day 4: Saturday

More woof. 

## Day 5: Sunday

New puppy arrives. I stay at Rose's place and look after Ziggy.

## Day 6: Monday

We take a walk at walk at the Crocodile Creek National Park.

## Day 7: Tuesday

Woof.

## Day 8: Wednesday

We take a long, boring, and exhausting walk on Magnetic island. After we get
back we find an interesting walk but are too exhausted to walk far on it, and
are running out of time before the ferry leaves.

## Day 9: Thursday

Woof.

## Day 10: Friday

We visit the quarantine museum and the aquarium.

## Day 11: Saturday

Lunch at The Sizzlers.
